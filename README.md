# Scones-Unlimited-Udacity-Project

This is an Udacity project for AWS Machine Learning Course.

In this project I 
- trained an Image classification model on AWS
- created lambda functions to deploy and test my model
- automated the lambda functions using Step Functions
- Monitored my model's performance after several execution of the step function workflow.

All the python files as well as the Step function Json file can be found in this repository.
